Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness only.\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9 to 10 Hz in frequency, 30 to 40 microvolt in amplitude seen the occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity which is distributed symmetrically.  Hyperventilation results in symmetric slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple/frequencies and resulted in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate is 60 to 70 beats per minute and regular.\\nCLINICAL EVENTS:  A 10:00:43 the patient reported that she has an attack described as her stomach is jumping with her arm on top of it.  She added that this is part of her attack.  At 10:06:01 she reported that she is feeling hot.  At 10:11:54 she stated that she is seeing blinking red stuff that hurts.

No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
